"""Integration tests for $rerank in MongoDBStore.search().

$rerank requires (all three must be satisfied — missing any one causes constant
scores of ~0.5987 rather than an error):
  - A real Atlas cluster (not local Docker) running MongoDB 8.3+
  - Native Reranking enabled in Atlas Project Settings
  - A Voyage AI API key configured in Atlas Project Settings

Tests are skipped automatically when MONGODB_URI points to localhost / 127.0.0.1.

--- Key test ---

test_rerank_changes_ordering_vs_vector_search demonstrates *why* reranking adds
value over vector search alone, using a corpus that exposes a well-known weakness
of embedding models: negation blindness.

Every document in the corpus contains the words "filling" and "two slices of
bread" — but documents 2-5 use those words in a negating context ("the filling
is NOT between them").  Embedding models are poor at negation and rank the
negating documents highly due to token overlap with the query.  The Voyage AI
reranker reads the full sentence, understands the negations, and promotes the
one document that affirmatively describes filling between bread to the top.
